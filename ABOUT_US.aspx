                    <br />
                    Founded as a single company cutting and polishing diamonds for the jewellery 
                trade in Rajkot, Gujarat. the PAYAL JEWELLERS Group became, many times over, a 
                pioneer among major diamond and jewellery houses.<br />
                    <br />
                    First major diamond and jewellery house to be launched and run by modern 
                entrepreneurs rather than dynastic jewellers. An authorised DTC Sightholder and 
                loyal customer &#8211; and a modern multinational business run on innovative insights.<br />
                    <br />
                    At the forefront of the global breakthrough in diamond jewellery design and 
                production brought about by India&#8217;s ability to cut diamonds considered 
                unworkable for jewellery till then. Has the distinction of producing the world&#8217;s 
                smallest heart shaped diamond (0.03 carat), and developing some 25 patented 
                facet patterns.<br />
                    <br />
                    Besides changing the face of manufacture, broke the mould of traditional 
                jewellery marketing: it abandoned jewellery trade convention by launching 
                multiple brands for multiple markets and price segments.<br />
                    <br />
                    Opened up distribution via superstores, department stores and other retail 
                outlets at MRP,supported by international certifications of scientifically 
                tested purity and authenticity, across India and in the world&#8217;s jewellery 
                capitals. Even markets branded jewellery directly by mail order catalogue.<br />
                    <br />
                    Business model now integrates all operations, from rough diamond sourcing, 
                cutting, polishing and distribution, and jewellery manufacture, to jewellery 
                branding and retail, as well as global lifestyle brands, in India and out of 
                india.<br />

                diamond studded jewellery at affordable prices, of standardised designs, quality
